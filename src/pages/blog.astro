  <h2>... and my new Astro site!</h2>

  <p>
    I am working through Astro's introductory tutorial. This is the second page
    on my website, and it's the first one I built myself!
  </p>

  <p>
    This site will update as I complete more of the tutorial, so keep checking
    back and see how my journey is going!
  </p>

  <ul>
    {
      allPosts.map((post: Post) => (
        <li>
          <a href={post.url}>{post.frontmatter.title}</a>
        </li>
      ))
    }
  </ul>
</BaseLayout>
